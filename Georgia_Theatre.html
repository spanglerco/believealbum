<p><div><br>As I am sure all of you have heard, the Georgia Theatre, an
artistic landmark of Athens, Georgia has suffered tremendous fire
damage. The full extent of the damage is unclear, as is the fire's
cause. What is known is that the theatre was recently renovated in an
effort to create a shining beacon for the vibrant array of music that
Athens has to offer.<br><br></div>
<div>The Belie-v-e project was founded on the idea that music as an
art-form can conquer the most challenging situations, that it brings
people together...if only for the duration of an album, or a
performance. On that note, we would like anyone who supported the
Belie-v-e album to take a hard look at the challenges that lie between
the fire and the ultimate reopening of the Georgia Theatre. With your
help, the Theatre can and will be rebuilt, and the streets of downtown
Athens will once again be filled with the sounds of every type of music
and performance. <br><br>From the doors of the Theatre there will once
again stream smiling humans, of every age, race and gender, satisfied
and moved after a night of beautiful music. The Theatre was more than a
room with a stage, it was a community that welcomed the people of
Athens and beyond into its halls for a time of celebration. Night after
night the Theatre supported us all with its service, and it is time we
repay the favor.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So please, from all of us at Belie-v-e, take the time to visit the
Venice is Sinking fundraising project (link below.) The band recorded
their third album at the Georgia Theatre, and have pledged to donate
every penny of profit to the Theatre to support it's staff and the
reconstruction efforts. This is a very noble project and needs all the
help it can get, so please pitch in!<br>http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/veniceissinking/help-us-press-our-third-album<br><br></div>
<div>Thank you all so much,</div>
